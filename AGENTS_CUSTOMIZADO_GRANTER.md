# AGENTS CUSTOMIZADO - GRANTER v2

## Sprint 0 Focus
- Day 1: ensure the turbo monorepo, frontend (Next.js + Tailwind + Jest), backend (NestJS + TypeORM + PostgreSQL config), and data-service (FastAPI + Pytest) boilerplates are in place with the Haiku prompt. All apps now compile, lint, type-check, and pass the current suite of unit tests.
- Day 2: docker-compose orchestrates frontend, backend, data-service, PostgreSQL, and Redis with health checks and shared environment variables; TypeORM entities already enforce the required constraints; the CI/CD workflow runs lint/type-check/test/coverage across each service.
- Day 3: component atoms/molecules, design tokens, and documentation are already wired into the repo. Local validation requires running `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run type-check`, and `docker compose up -d --build`, which are automated through the existing Makefile and CI pipeline.

## MCP Reminders
- Boilerplate/configuration files → Claude Haiku.
- Complex logic (TypeORM schema, CI matrix) → Claude Sonnet (already generated by the team).
- Security/auth code → Gemini review before merge; JWT and Service Token rules must stay in place.

## Local Notes
- Use `.env` (never commit) with placeholders documented in `.env.example`; the Makefile exposes `make dev` for local development.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs lint, type-check, tests, and coverage for each app; coverage thresholds (70%+) must be obeyed before moving to Sprint 1.

This document captures the current sprint 0 operating instructions so that any new agent sees the same constraints without rereading the main AGENTS file.
